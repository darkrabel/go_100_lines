# go in 1oo lines
In the following 100 lines of code, we’ll go through several examples illustrating Go’s features. We’ll cover how to declare variables, understand Go’s built-in types, work with arrays and slices, cover maps, and touch on the flow of control. From there, we’ll go beyond 100 lines and also look at pointers, structs, and Go’s built-in support for concurrency.
# About go.
Go is an open-source programming language developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is often described as “C for the 21st century”, however, it borrows important ideas from several other languages like ALGOL, Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon, CSP, and others. At its core, Go relies on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency to overcome the shortcomings of its ancestors. Go has garbage collection, a package system, first-class functions, lexical scope, immutable strings that rely on UTF-8, and an awesome concurrency model.

As a compiled language, Go is generally faster than interpreted languages and is safer from crashes thanks to its built-in type system. That being said, there is a good balance between expressiveness and safety that gives programmers the benefits of a strong type system without the burden of complex workflows.

The use cases of the language vary from network servers and distributed systems to CLI’s, web and mobile development, scalable databases, and cloud-native applications.

# variable 
When writing Go programs, variables must be declared before they can be used. The example below shows how to declare single variables or a group of variables. In the interest of space, the output is displayed as an in-line comment.
